\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In a commodity trading market the price level is expected to be tied to
commodity system dynamics, namely supply, demand, and delivery of the
commodity being traded. Volatility, the variation in price over time,
reflects uncertainty in the balance of these system factors. This
research paper aims to answer a simply posed question: ``does oil price
volatility scale with price?''; i.e., can we expect to observe larger
price swings when the price is near \$100 per barrel vs \$20 per barrel?

If oil price volatility reflects uncertainty about supply and demand
dynamics, it isn't immediately clear whether we should expect volatility
to depend on price level. Higher oil prices are associated with
``tightness'' in the supply market, meaning there is little excess
capacity to increase production, therefore we may expect swings higher
but some base price support that results in lower measured volatility.
Likewise, low prices may suggest excess capacity that can buffer shocks
to the oil delivery system, dampening volatility. Despite these ``just
so'' arguments, a multitude of factors such as storage dynamics, supply
chain disruptions, the ability of producers to increase production to
bring more oil to market or shut in production capacity in response to
prices (``rebalancing''), and market speculation complicate this picture
and suggest it must be studied empirically.

If it is found that oil price volatility is dependent on price level,
the relationship may follow a scaling formula. For instance, if we can
expect volatility of \$1 perbarrel when oil is at \$20 per barrel, can
we expect volatility of \$5 per barrel at \$100 per barrel price levels
via a simple linear scaling rule? Three methods are presented in this
research paper to answer this question: (1) regression modeling of price
and volatility, (2) viewing volatility within oil price regimes, and (3)
using multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) modeling.

Note that in this research paper \emph{oil price} is used to
specifically mean spot-traded crude oil. This represents only one
component of the oil markets, and 90\%-95\% of oil is sold under term
contracts (Platts, 2010). Still, the spot price of oil is an important
economic indicator used by the U.S. Federal Reserve as consideration for
monetary policy. This research paper is concerned with understanding the
energy system using pricing information. In this way, it differs from
much of the published research in that it is not concerned with
forecasting prices or volatility. Nor is it addressing exogeneous system
elements such as equity markets or interest rates, though the literature
shows that the crude oil market and larger economic indicators are
intertwined (add cite). Instead, it contributes to our understanding of
the system dynamics of an essential energy commodity.

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}

\subsection{Data Source}\label{data-source}

The data source is the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) nominal (i.e.~not
inflation adjusted) daily spot price record from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. Using nominal prices maintains the ability
to assess volatility for a given time period without introducing an
exogenous factor via inflation adjustment. The WTI series was filtered
to the date range January 2, 1986 through December 30, 2016 (Table 1).

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Returns and Volatility}\label{returns-and-volatility}

In this research paper, volatility is characterized two ways: (1) 5-day
historic volatility and (2) 30-day historic volatility. Historic
volatility is defined as: \[V_{H,t}=\sqrt{N}sd(P)\]

In addition, the relationship between the returns themselves and price
level is investigated. Daily returns were calculated as:
\[R_t = \ln({P_t-P_{t-1}})\] Note that the standard return formula takes
the log of the daily price differences, meaning the day to day price
differences are scaled using a natural logarithm. In some sections, the
absolute value of ``unscaled returns'' (i.e. \(|P_t-P_{t-1}|\)) are used
in order to investigate the scaling of the return series.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Price level, return, and volatility series plots of WTI spot
oil prices.}
\end{figure}

A seen in Figure 1, most of the series from 1986 through 2004 contains
prices between \$10/barrel and \$40/barrel. This results in a price
series with a skewness value 0.98 and a long right tail (Figure 2), with
most prices being around the series median of \$28 per barrel. The
return series exhibits fatter tails and a narrower center than a normal
distribution of the same descriptive parameters. The kurtosis value of
the return series is 13.52. Returns with excess kurtosis compared to
normally distributed returns is a common characteristic in financial
time series. This indicates that most returns are very close to the mean
return, but some returns are dispersed very far from the mean.

distributions for comparison.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Autocorrelations}\label{autocorrelations}

The autocorrelation plots for the oil price and return series indicate a
high degree of correlation between adjacent observations. While we are
not utilizing an autoregressive model here, partial autocorrelations are
also shown in Figure 3 to show that partial autocorrelations do not
exist in the price series after a shift of 1 day, compared to a longer
partial autocorrelation decay in the return series.

\end{figure}

\section{Price-Volatility Regression
Analysis}\label{price-volatility-regression-analysis}

Relating price level and the measures of volatility at each time in the
series is a simple exploration of the research problem. The covariance
and correlation measures of vectors representing price versus returns,
30-day, and 5-day historic volatility indicate a weak, negative
relationship (Table 2). However, the unscaled return series indicates a
stronger positive covariance and correlation with the price series.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lrr@{}}
\caption{Covariance and correlation of price level and returns, 30-day,
and 5-day historic volatility.}\tabularnewline
\toprule
& Covariance & Correlation\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endfirsthead
\toprule
& Covariance & Correlation\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Return Series & 0.0102677 & 0.0134110\tabularnewline
Unscaled Return Series & 12.0871446 & 0.4393373\tabularnewline
30-day Historic Volatility & -1.0525476 & -0.1860878\tabularnewline
5-day Historic Volatility & -0.8388984 & -0.1123822\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

In quantitative finance, a process where volatility scales with price is
a lognormal process. When volatility is independent of price, the
process is normal (Ho and Lee, 2003). Regression of the price level and
squared returns is identified as the method of distinguishing lognormal
from normal processes in the literature. Figure 4 shows scatter plots of
the two return series and two historic volatility measures fitted with a
linear regression model.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}
\caption{Scatterplots with a linear model relating spot oil price with
returns, 30-day, and 5-day historic volatility.}
\end{figure}

The case of 30-day historic volatility indicates a negative relationship
between price level and volatility. However, this result appears to be
due to a cluster high volatility around \$20 per barrel, creating a
leverage point. In addition, it is obvious from even the scatter plot
that residuals will not indicate stochastic error.

The unscaled returns appear to indicate an increasing relationship
between day-over-day price change and base price. The resulting linear
model is: \(R_t = 0.013P_t+0.14\) has an \(R^2\) value of 0.19.
Analyzing the residuals by calculating Cook's Distance indicates that
massive price movements in the fall of 2008 resulting from the financial
crises are acting as leverage points and the relationship between
unscaled returns and price may be weaker than indicated by the linear
model.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figs/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}
\caption{Cook's Distance plot indicating measurements acting as leverage
points.}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure 1, nominal oil prices have spent time as high as \$145
per barrel. However, the majority of the time series is far lower, with
a median price of \$28 per barrel. This means that the data set is
unbalanced and higher price levels represent a smaller portion of the
data set. In addition, oil price (and financial time series in general)
exhibits volatility clustering. Therefore, it is anticipated that this
simple regression model based on price and volatility is not the best
possible solution to the question of characterizing the dependency of
volatility on price. A second time series was created by limiting WTI
prices to the January 3, 1998 through December 31, 2016. This results in
a distribution that, while significantly different than the normal
distribution, is more evenly distributed across the price range from
\$10.82 per barrel to \$145.30 per barrel (Figure 5).

Given the ever evolving economic, political, and technological landscape
affect commodity prices, there is some trade off between looking at a
large historic price record, which covers a larger data set of possible
system states (and higher statistical power), and limiting to a more
recent price record, which more fully represents the system in its
current state. However, the linear models relating price level to
returns and volatility resulting from the recent time series does not
differ much from using the full data set. In general there is a weak,
negative correlation between volatility and price, and a weak positive
correlation between returns and price.

This simple method of exploring the relationship between price level and
volatility does not provide a satisfactory explanation of whether we can
expect more volatility, indicating more commodity system uncertainty, at
high price levels. Volatility in financial time series tend to cluster.
Typically, some event (called a ``shock'') occurs which results in an
extremely high price movement. These are the large noticeable movements
in the return series (Figure 1). Subsequent returns are also of higher
magnitude than the typical return size, but taper off over time,
eventually returning to a value close to the average return for the
price series. This is referred to as volatility clustering, and
indicates heterosketasticity in the variance component of a time series.
This violates the assumption in the most frequently used time series
model, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.

These results using simple linear regression models to study how daily
returns and historic volatility relate to price level may not adequately
deal with this time-varying variance structure. If, for a given price
level, we have a price shock, we expect the volatility to return back to
its normal level. So at that price level we may have relatively few
measurements indicating high volatility, resulting in regression models
heavily weighted towards the baseline level of volatility. This ``one to
one'' view of the price level - volatility relationship leaves the
question open as to whether we can anticipate more volatility or larger
price shocks at higher price levels.

\section{Comparing Volatility across Price
Regimes}\label{comparing-volatility-across-price-regimes}

Regime switching has been investigated in oil prices, however the focus
has been on breaking volatility into regimes (Vo, 2009). In order to
capture the volatility dynamics of the WTI price series, including
volatility clustering and changes in base price, change point detection
was used to break the series into price regimes. Change point detection
aims to detect the point or points where the statistical properties of a
sequence of observations change (Killick et al., 2016). Change point
detection was used to estimate changes in the oil price mean throughout
the period of record using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm
(Killick et al. 2012). The time series between these change points
represent ``price regimes'' (i.e.~time series between change points)
which have generally similar mean oil price compared to the entire
record.

Change point detection proceeds by minimizing a cost function over
possible locations and number of change points. The cost function:
\[\sum_{i=1}^{m+1}[C(y_{(\tau_{i-1}+1):\tau_i})]+\beta f(m) \] Where
\(m\) is the number of change points and their positions in the series
at \(\tau_{1:m}=(\tau_1,...,\tau_m)\), within a series
\(y_{1:n} = (y_1,...,y_n)\). \(C\) is a cost function for a segment and
\(\beta f(m)\) is a penalty to increase the threshold to identify a
changepoint, thereby preventing overfitting (Killick ET AL., 2012).
Minimizing this calculation can be computationally demanding, hence the
development of algorithms such as PELT, however for the oil price series
this is not a practical constraint.

The change point analysis was performed with a minimum regime length of
250 trading days, approximately one calendar year. The cost value was
set to 10,000. This parameterization resulted in 15 price regimes (i.e.
\(m+1\) change points). Then, within each regime the standard deviation
(to indicate volatility) and median price were calculated.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances
## 
## data:  wti.regimes.ret$returns and wti.regimes.ret$regime
## Fligner-Killeen:med chi-squared = 587.38, df = 14, p-value <
## 2.2e-16
\end{verbatim}

The Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances determines if it is
appropriate to reject the null hypothesis that the variances between
each regime are the same. This test was chosen due to it's suitability
for non-normal data. The chi-squared value of the test was 587.38 and
the p-value was less than 2.2e-16, indicating it is appropriate to
conclude the variances across the regimes are different.

The data set describing the regimes were then modeled using linear
regression (Figure 6). The resulting model indicates a slope of 0.08,
meaning that for every dollar increase in the median price of a price
regime, we expect an increase in the standard deviation of that regime
of 0.08. This model has an adjusted r-squared value of 0.45.

\end{figure}

Analyzing the residuals of this model indicate some problems with the
fit (Figure 7). Namely, residuals are not evenly distributed and the
model is subject to suspected leverage point observations. This is
typical in linear models with small sample sizes.

This section's analysis using changepoint analysis to break the oil
price series into price regimes as defined by changes in the series mean
is highly dependent upon model parameters. The PELT change point
detection method identifies different regimes depending on the minimum
segment length and penalty parameters, and based on the section of the
time series used. An interactive Shiny App was created and may be access
in order to try different parameterizations of the change point model
and view the effects on the relationship between medial regime price and
standard deviation within that regime:
(\url{https://jhamski.shinyapps.io/oil_price_regimes_and_volatility/}).

\section{Multivariate GARCH Model}\label{multivariate-garch-model}

Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models
attempt to model the variance component of a time series. They can
account for asymmetric, clustered time series variance and has
successfully been applied to model oil prices (Salisu and Fasanya, 2012;
Narayan and Narayan, 2007). Most of the literature exploring GARCH
models is interested in predicting volatility and identifying volatility
relationships across different time series, for instance volatility in
oil price also occurring when there is volatility in the stock market.

Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) models are based on univariate
GARCH models. They parameterize the conditional correlations directly
and are estimated in two steps -- the first is a series of univariate
GARCH estimates and the second the resulting correlation estimate. The
correlation is ``conditional'' because it is based on the knowledge of
the series at one time step before the time the correlation is
calculated. Essentially, DCC is looking for ``contemporaneous
correlation'' in the variance of two series.

This study is attempting a multivariate GARCH model using a return
series, which is derived from the price series, and the price series
itself. While using a derivative of a series is common in time series
analysis (i.e.~autoregressive models), this doe snot appear to be a
common

A DCC model was constructed from an ARMA(1,1) and
Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH model. This means that we specified a
base model for the conditional mean using an
autoregressive--moving-average (ARMA) model with an autoregressive term
of one and a moving average term of on. Note that the same terms used in
Narayan and Narayan, 2007, an ARMA(12,12) model, were used. However all
models built failed to converge. This may indicate that there is a
problem with linear combinations resulting from building a model with
price level and volatility.

The resulting conditional covariance chart (Figure 8) shows that during
times of high volatility, the price level and returns have covariance
values as high as 0.4 and 0.55. However, in general the value is less
than 0.1. This result does not lead to a clear conclusion and the
methodology laid out in this section requires more work.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This analysis suggests that the question ``does oil price volatility
scale with price?'' requires further clarification to address.

\emph{Expected Returns at a Given Price Level}

The regression of unscaled returns to price level indicates that we may
expect returns to increase linearly with increasing price. The resulting
linear model \(R_t = 0.013P_t+0.14\) indicates that for every one dollar
increase in price, we may anticipate a 1.3 cent increase in expected
returns. However, with an \(R^2\) value of 0.19 the model does not
explain most of the variation in the relationship between unscaled
returns and base price.

\emph{Volatility Within Price Regimes}\\
Detecting change points, breaking the price series into regimes, and
comparing the standard deviation within those regimes provides the
clearest evidence that we may expect higher volatility at higher prices.
This method has the benefit of capturing volatility clustering and is
less suseptable to imbalance due to the high kurtosis of the return
series. Based on this method, we may expect the standard deviation of
our returns (i.e.~volatility within a price regime) to increase by 0.8
cents for every one dollar increase in that regime's median price.

\emph{Multivariate GARCH Models using Price Level, Returns, and
Volatility}

The method of using DCC models to investigate the relationship between
oil price and volatility requires further exploration and theory
development. It is not clear that the method of modeling volatility
using a GARCH model will allow us to determine if price level is a an
explanatory factor of volatility.
